## CO-PO Mapping

### Instructions for Mapping:
Mapping CO's Vs PO's/PSO's need to be provided wherever it is appropriate. The correlation levels can be given based on below given parameters with respect to the Program attributes. the parameters are as follows:

- Course content
- Content delivery
- Pedagogy tools
- Assessment tools used to measure the student's performance
- Correlation levels

> Slight (Map it with 1 correlation when the above-mentioned parameters are slightly influencing in students learning).
> Moderate (Map it with 2 correlation when the above-mentioned parameters are moderately influencing in students learning).
> Substantial (Map it with 3 correlation when the above-mentioned parameters are strongly influencing in students learning).

**If there is no correlation, put "NA"**
